Risks/Rewards:
(If death is permanent:  What are the non-death risks?)


Main Cycle:
(in standard mmo, main cycle is kill stuff -> (stay alive) -> get money/exp to improve character -> get better at killing stuff -> be able to kill bigger things -> open up new area with bigger reward opportunities.  Also find questgiver -> explore region -> accomplish quest -> return to questgiver -> get reward.

In alpha centauri, main cycle is llo



Initial Goal:
Capt Ramses: Colony needs water, energy to survive its first year.
             Here's your time limit, here's the bare minimum, here's what
             we'd like to have.  Go!


Skill Atoms:
    1. I can collect resources from squares and cash them in!
           --> And get EXP for this
    2. Some mineable areas are better than others, but they're farther away.
            --> Player should be able to get a cool reward after the very
                 first mineral trip
    3. If I stay out too long or stray too far from base, I will start
          to run out of air. 
    4. But players can help each other reach farther areas away (how?)
            --> Exchange info on best spots
            --> Increase carrying capacity (how?)
            --> Increase movement speed (how?)
            --> Help each other if you get into trouble

    Big lesson:  We're way more effective if we work together

    5. There are native creatures that will attack me and I have to stay
           away from them.  (risk assesment)  (These creatures are attracted
            to the best mineral mining areas themselves; they're crystalvores
            or something)

    6. But if I bring a Marine along, they can shoot the creatures to scare
            them away.  (and get EXP for this)

    7. With enough minerals, I can visit the microfactory and have it build me
            a constructobot (fanfare!)

    8. With the constructobot, I can make solar panels

    9. The solar panels require cables to connect them back to the base
         -> Once connected, I get rewarded (fanfare!) more exp, money

    10. There are alien creatures who will attack and destroy solar panels
         or cables.
           -> A tech can repair them
           -> A marine can fight off the attackers
           -> a scientist can analyze captured creatures to develop
              countermeasures

    11. Some spots for solar panels are better than others
          (but may not be cost-effective if they're too far away)
          -> Scientist can analyze squares to find the most effective ones

    12. With money and minerals, I can upgrade my suit to stay out longer and
           go farther.  (When I go farther, I see signs of interesting things
            that I don't know how to interact with yet.)

    13. Also upgrade my constructobot or buy multiples for faster work

    14. Upgraded constructobot can alter landscape (dig tunnel, build ramp)
             to make it easier to get cables to difficult locations

    15. When enough energy goes back to the base, new parts light up and new
             options become available (for everyone!)

    16. But the base's water supplies go down with each person who passes
             through.  And it's giving us a warning that it will be game over
             if the minimum water needs are not met.

    17. There's two ways to get water: condensers, or purification of rivers.
             (How do players find this out?)

    18. Condensers are basically like solar panels except that different
           squares have moisture than have sunlight...
              (This is kind of boring, though.  Should have something else...)
              (Condensers have to be developed first using Science?)
              (Condensers easier to get but not nearly as effective as river
                 water purifiers?)

    19. River water purifiers DEFINITELY need Science.  You need to discover
          all kinda stuff about native microbes and how to kill them and stuff.
         This makes it way important to climb the tech tree and doesn't give
          people other than scientists musch to do other than like hunt
          bacteria or something... this needs a think through.
